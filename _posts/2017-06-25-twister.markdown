## Twister

## Multimedia
If we had to choose one word to describe Twister that would be it. Twister is a theme that focusses on multimedia. It contains different post types to create video posts, audio posts, image post or gallery posts with ease. We created a ton of Variables, that make customization super easy.

This theme is powerful and it comes with a few extras.

## Features
The theme comes with a grunt file, which means that working with it is super easy. We have Tasks that compile, concatenate, minify and even deploy to your site.

### Front Matter Generator
Twister comes with a front matter generator that will make generating the front matter for each post a breeze. So you don't have to remember each and every variable name, the generator will help you with that.

### Extensive Documentation
We don't believe in delivering Code without explanation. So we wrote an extensive Documentation for Twister that goes over every single step from installing all of the dependencies to explaining how to customize, create posts and publish. We even tell you how you can host Twister with Plugins on GitHub pages.

Check the [Docs](http://twister.digitalmind.ch/documentation/) out.
